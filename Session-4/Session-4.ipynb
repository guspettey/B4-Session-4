    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this assessment for B4 - Python is for you to demonstrate:\n",
    "- You can take a unfamiliar python code and deduce how it works;\n",
    "- You can develop that script to solve new, related problems;\n",
    "- You can demonstrate good programming technique e.g. in commenting and producing scientific plots;\n",
    "- You can import new data and create meaningful engineering analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this assessment you should make sure to add comments which explain/describe what your code is attempting to do. \n",
    "If you use any sources of information aside from the documentation for various modules (numpy, matplotlib), you should add a link to the page in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are permitted to use other sources, including ChatGPT (or other AI models), but you are still expected to explain the code, as per the rubric.\n",
    "The rubric for this assessment is available on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The deadline for this assessment is 12:30pm, 20th February 2025.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The expected time for completion of this work is 2 hours.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting your work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have completed the tasks below, you will need to submit your code to the dropbox on moodle in two separate files, one for each part of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should create a new python file by navigating to 'File -> New -> Python File'. \n",
    "- Copy and paste your code into the blank python file. \n",
    "- When you have completed your file, navigate to 'File -> Save Python File' and name your file either PartA.py or PartB.py.\n",
    "- You can download this file by navigating to 'File -> Download' or right-clicking on the file. \n",
    "- This will download the file to your device, at which point you can upload it to moodle in the usual fashion.\n",

    "The approach can be used to compute the trajectory of a ballistic cannon ball, for example. \n",
    "The position of the cannon ball can be difficult to predict if factors like the drag and wind speed are taken into account. \n",
    "he problem can be solved by dividing the problem is small time steps and assume the velocity of the ball is constant in each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) speeds ($\\dot{x}$,$\\dot{y}$ ) at the end of each time interval (denoted by subscript $i + 1$) can be computed based on the properties of the system at the beginning of the interval (denoted by subscript $i$) as\n",

    "4. Produce a line plot comparing all sources of energy over the range of years in the file; \n",
    "5. Add a secondary y axis showing the price of electricity over the same range. You should not correct the price data. Your plot should have appropriate x and y labels, a legend, and have sensible distinction between the energy supply and price data.\n",
